# ☁️ Terraform Infrastructure Patterns

Welcome to this repository! 
This project serves as a collection of practical Terraform implementations and architectural patterns.
The goal is to provide ready-to-use examples that demonstrate how to solve common infrastructure challenges.

💡 Note: Infrastructure is rarely "one size fits all." Every use case is unique. 
These examples are intended as a reference for using Terraform resources. They are not "plug-and-play" solutions. Users are responsible for adapting the code to meet their own architectural, security, and compliance requirements.

If one of these examples helps you solve a specific problem or accelerates your development process, then this repository has served its purpose.

## 📂 Available Examples

**📍 Location:** [`/remote-state`](./remote-state)
